1. Project Summary
The Auction Web Application is a simple yet effective web-based platform designed to facilitate online auctions. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project enables users to log in and participate in auctions for various categories including cars, jewellery, and paintings. The application provides a basic interface and interactive features to simulate an auction environment.

2. Overview
The Auction Web Application serves as an introductory example of a web-based auction system. It is designed to provide a user-friendly interface where individuals can browse auction items, place bids, and manage their profiles.
Key Features:
•	Login Functionality: Allows users to access the auction platform through a secure login page.
•	Category-Specific Pages: Dedicated pages for different item categories such as cars, jewellery, and paintings.
•	Responsive Design: Separate CSS files ensure that each page is visually appealing and functional across different devices.
•	Interactive Elements: JavaScript is used to enhance user interactions, such as placing bids and navigating between pages.
